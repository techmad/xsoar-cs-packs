One of the main processes of working with indicators is sending them to 3rd party systems such as SIEM systems in order to allow correlations, reporting and searching for indicators within the SIEM.\nThe TIM - SIEM Integration pack includes playbooks that automate the process of sending indicators to 3rd party SIEM systems including ArcSight and QRadar. By customizing which indicators should be sent to SIEM.\nWith this content pack, you can significantly reduce the time and effort by automating the delivery of indicators to your SIEM, with minimal configuration.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\n\nThe playbooks included in this pack help you automate repetitive tasks associated with with the handling of indicators:\n\n- Sending indicators of type IP, Domains, URLs and more to the customers SIEM product of choice.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks)_",
