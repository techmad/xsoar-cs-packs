It can also be used for other incident types by adding the email communication layout to the different incident types.\n\n##### What does this pack do?\nThe layout helps you communicate and respond to emails in the Cortex XSOAR system:\n- Add CC to the email\n- Write the email you want to send\n- Add attachments if needed to the email.\n- Tag all the related emails (incoming/outgoing) to the incident and manage as an email thread - the user can view all the communications in the layout without leaving the system.\n\nThis pack includes, out of the box, a full layout, scripts, and incident fields. All of these are customizable to suit the needs of your organization.\n\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/)\n\n![Email_Communication_layout](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/master/Packs/EmailCommunication/doc_files/Email_Communication_layout.png)\n",
