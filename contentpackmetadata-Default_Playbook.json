When you simply create an incident from scratch or just want to get more information about an indicator without performing a full investigation, we recommend using our Default playbook.\r\n\r\nThis pack provides you with the Default playbook which automates the much-needed core steps of enrichment and severity calculation for any kind of incident.\r\n\r\n##### What does this pack do?\r\nExtracts indicators from any data within the incident.\r\nEnriches all indicators involved in the incident.\r\nCalculates severity for the incident, taking into account the initial incident severity, indicator reputation and any critical assets found as indicators\r\n\r\nThe playbook found in this pack provides a great out-of-the-box solution, yet it can be customized should you want to add additional logic to the default behavior.\r\n\r\n_For more information, visit our [Cortex XSOAR Developer Docs](https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/playbooks/phishing-investigation---generic-v2)_\r\n\r\n![Default](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/demisto/content/fb32f760304f6430237fee965ce834c3c1adcbda/Packs/DefaultPlaybook/doc_files/Default.png)\r\n",
